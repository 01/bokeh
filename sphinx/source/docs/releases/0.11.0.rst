Migration Guide
---------------

The previous Flask-based ``bokeh-server`` has been completely removed and
replaced with the new ``bokeh serve`` based on Tornado and a websocket
protocol. If you require to use ``bokeh-server`` you will have to remain on
Bokeh version ``0.10.0`` or lower.

All "old-style" charts in ``bokeh._legacy_charts`` have been updated to use
the more consistent and powerful ``bokeh.charts`` interface, and
``bokeh._legacy_charts`` has been removed.

Bokeh deprecation warnings, which are not enabled by default python, have
now been unconditionally enabled and are always displayed.

``ColumnDataSource.push_notebook()`` has been deprecated (but still works)
in favor of the more general ``bokeh.io.push_notebook()`` base on Jupyter
notebook websocket comms.

The following modules have been deprecated (but still work), with
new counterparts as described in this table:

========================== ==============================
Old location               New location
========================== ==============================
``bokeh.browserlib``       ``bokeh.util.browser``
``bokeh.properties``       ``bokeh.core.properties``
``bokeh.mixins``           ``bokeh.core.property_mixins``
``bokeh.plotting_helpers`` ``bokeh.plotting.helpers``
``bokeh.templates``        ``bokeh.core.templates``
========================== ==============================

Additionally, the following modules that should not be of interest to
general users have been moved immediately, without deprecation:

========================== ==============================
Old location               New location
========================== ==============================
``bokeh._json_encoder``    ``bokeh.core.json_encoder``
``bokeh.compat``           ``bokeh.core.compat``
``bokeh.enums``            ``bokeh.core.enums``
``bokeh.query``            ``bokeh.core.query``
``bokeh.state``            ``bokeh.core.state``
``bokeh.validation``       ``bokeh.core.validation``
========================== ==============================
