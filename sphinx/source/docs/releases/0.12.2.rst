0.12.2 (Sept 2016)
=================

We're pleased to announce the release of Bokeh 0.12.2! This minor update
adds a few "small in footprint, but big in impact" features and several bug
fixes including:

* Color mapping support for all glyphs
* New color bar annotation (to visualize your color mapped data, obviously)
* Added support for loading external resources in custom models (including LaTeX example)
* Hit-testing support for MultiLine glyphs
* Improved tooltip default styling for HoverTool
* Addition of the Brewer qualitative color palettes
* Split of the Bokeh JS API into a stand-alone file
* Fix bug in LassoSelectTool selection area rendering
* Fix intermittent issues with BokehJS loading in Jupyter notebooks.
* Fix MultiSelect widget to allow values or values and labels

NOTE: the 0.12.x series is the last planned release series before a
version 1.0 release. The focus of the 1.0 release will be implementing
build automation to enforce API stability, and a very small number of
high value features.
