.. _about:

Bokeh (pronounced bo-Kay or bo-Kuh) is a Python interactive visualization
library for large datasets that natively uses the latest web technologies.
Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the
style of Protovis/D3, while delivering high-performance interactivity over
large data to thin clients.
