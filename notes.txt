These are random notes as I'm understanding how ggplot is put together (and
also learn a bit more concretely about GG itself).

The geom_abline example shows how if the data supplied to the geom function is vector with regards to the dimensionality of the geom, then it broadcasts.  I wonder how R is implementing this under the hood, or if it's some special case code.

Some functions have parameters that control the widget's appearance, and which can oftentimes accept any aesthetic.
