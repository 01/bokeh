def downsample(data, glyphspec, grid, transfer):
  """AR Downsample uses abstract rendering to convert a dataset
     into another.  The glyphspec is used to conver the dataset
     into a visualization (well...just the center part, not the axes/legend/etc).
     The grid is used to discretize that visualization and 
     the transfer is used do analysis on the discretized data.
     The result of transfer is an arbitrary dataset...which then
     may be visualized."""
